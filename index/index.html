        <p id="bioPara_1">
          On Friday the 13th in October of 1307, King Philip IV of France ordered the arrest of the Knights Templar and had them tortured and killed; and in July of 2013, two musicians named Ryan Vuckovich (singer) and Nicholas Hrboka (guitarist) contemplated how they would kill and torture audiences with the best Misfits tribute ever assembled. Their first plan of attack was to be one of the few tributes that would not only play Glen Danzig era Misfits, but would also play a heavy assortment of Michael Graves Misfits—an amazing and sadly underappreciated period in the bands history. Next, a name needed to be chosen; one that would properly represent the sonic assault. Boka, a fan of Adam Sandler films, shouted out loud the band’s war-cry: “Doyle Rules”—a play off of “O’Doyle Rules” from Billy Madison. The name was perfect. When any punk fan heard the scream Doyle Rules they knew that they would be experiencing a tribute that would play songs from an era that included Danzig and Graves songs— the Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein era of the Misfits. Now all that needed to be done was to complete the lineup. Ryan called up his old friends AJ Graves (drums) and Danny Molina (bass), both avid Misfits fans who were excited to try out. The four musicians blasted through 20 plus songs in less than an hour and they all knew that this force was going to work.

          The band could have started their attack early that summer but decided it would be more fitting to wait till the month of Halloween when Fiends were hungry to hear Misfits; and on October 3rd 2013 at a venue in Pasadena called the Terrance, Doyle Rules made their debut to a crowd that were not satisfied with the 45 minute set the band played—they wanted to hear more. So in order to quench the hunger, Fiends followed the trail of blood that Doyle Rules left at every performance; and for 5 years these Fiends have continued to follow the band that will play their favorite Misfits songs off classic albums like Static Age, Earth A.D., American Psycho, and Famous Monsters. Fiends have also been treated to special executions like the time the band performed the album Walk Among Us in its entirety. Now, with the addition of Jesse “Chainsaw” Brown (guitar) and Roman Moreno (bass), Doyle Rules will continue to slaughter any other Misfits tribute who thinks that they can take on the gang; because when these guys play, “DEATH COMES RIPPING!”
